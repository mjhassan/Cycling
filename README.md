Go Cycling Journey Capture - iOS App
====================================

iOS app for Journey Capture and Planning. 

The Future City demonstrator is looking at active travel in Glasgow – walking and cycling. Active travel can deliver substantial health benefits as well as helping tackling some of our environmental issues such as emissions and congestion.  However for us to really drive change in the city, we need better data and a better understanding of how the city moves on 2 wheels. And the real knowledge lies with the people who cycle in the city

By using the power of the smartphone in your pocket we can help empower the cycling population of Glasgow. By giving visibility of route’s, the times  types of journeys being undertaken by the citizens of Glasgow, together we can build a true picture of our cycling needs and allow the city to deliver a better cycling experience to citizens and visitors.

The first step to this is creating a mobile application for iPhones. We would love for you to join our test programme and help us shape the application so it fully meets the needs of Glasgow’s cycling community.

This app should be viewed as an example of the Go Cycling Journey Capture API and help with development of visualisations and extensions to the API.
